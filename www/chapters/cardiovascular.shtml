<A NAME="cardio2"></A>
<P><H3><I>Epicardial and Myocardial Mineralization</I></H3>

<P>Mineralization of the myocardium and epicardium occurs in various strains of mice as early as one 
month of age, and is more common in males than in females; it occurs most often on the right 
ventricle. Microscopically, the mineralized foci are characterized by distinctly basophilic areas 
after hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining 
(<a href="javascript:windowf2 = window.open('../figures/figure2.shtml', 'windowf2', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf2.focus()">Fig. 2</A>) 
by black areas when stained with von Kossa 
(<a href="javascript:windowf3 = window.open('../figures/figure3.shtml', 'windowf3', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf3.focus()">Fig. 3</A>) 
and red areas when stained with Alizarin Red 
(<a href="javascript:windowf4 = window.open('../figures/figure4.shtml', 'windowf4', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf4.focus()">Fig. 4</A>). 
The mineralization may be minimal or quite extensive covering most of the 
epicardial surface of the right ventricle. The mineralized areas may be surrounded by fibrosis, but 
an inflammatory component is minimal. The exact etiology is unknown but the lesion appears to have 
a genetic predisposition 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#DiPaola1964">DiPaola <I>et al.</I>, 1964</A>; 
<A HREF="references.shtml#Brownstein1983">Brownstein, 1983</A>). The incidence of the epicardial mineralization in BALB/c mice at 
the NCTR was significantly higher in the male (10.5%) than in the female mice (3.6%) and increased 
slightly with age in both sexes 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Frith1975">Frith <I>et al.</I>, 1975</A>). The incidence of spontaneous mineralization was much 
higher in the BALB/c mice than in other strains studied at the NCTR in which mice of similar age 
were subjected to comparable stress factors, environment and diet.

<P>Mineralization of the myocardium is also a common lesion in a number of strains of mice 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Rings1972">Rings and Wagner, 1972</A>). The mineralized areas are focal and may involve the 
myocardium of both ventricles and the intraventricular septum. The atria are usually spared. The 
lesion appears to be a distinct entity and different from the epicardial mineralization. 
Microscopically the mineralized areas stain distinctly basophilic with H & E 
(<a href="javascript:windowf5 = window.open('../figures/figure5.shtml', 'windowf5', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf5.focus()">Fig. 5</A>). 
The focal areas of mineralization are often surrounded by fibrous 
connective tissue and a minimal infiltrate of mononuclear inflammatory cells is present. 
Myocardial mineralization (calcification) may be induced by low protein diets and mineral imbalance 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Highman1951">Highman and Daft, 1951</A>).

<A NAME="cardio3"></A>
<P><H3><I>Atrial Thrombosis</I></H3>

<P>Atrial thrombosis is not a common lesion but occurs as both a spontaneous and an 
induced lesion in mice 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Schieferstein1985">Schieferstein <I>et al.</I>, 1985</A>). The thrombus more commonly involves the left 
atrium. Grossly, the involved atrium is enlarged and red. Microscopically, the distended atrium 
contains an organizing mural thrombus 
(<a href="javascript:windowf6 = window.open('../figures/figure6.shtml', 'windowf6', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf6.focus()">Fig. 6</A>). 
The degree of organization depends upon the age of the thrombus. Some of 
the thrombi may contain focal areas of cartilaginous metaplasia 
(<a href="javascript:windowf7 = window.open('../figures/figure7.shtml', 'windowf7', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf7.focus()">Fig. 7</A>). 
If the thrombi are large, they may lead to a secondary chronic passive 
congestion of the lungs. Thrombosis may be associated with uremia and kidney disease, 
including amyloidosis.

<A NAME="cardio4"></A>
<P><H2>Vessels</H2>

<A NAME="cardio5"></A>
<P><H3><I>Medial Hypertrophy</I></H3>

<P>Medial hypertrophy involves an increase in the medial mass of small muscular arteries. The 
etiology of the medial hypertrophy is often obscure and the thickened vessels may be found in 
various organs. Microscopically it may be difficult to determine if the increased muscular mass is 
due to a hypertrophy or hyperplasia of the smooth muscle cells or merely represents a contraction 
of the vessel resulting in an apparent thickening but no increase of the muscle layer. The vessels 
often appear otherwise normal 
(<a href="javascript:windowf8 = window.open('../figures/figure8.shtml', 'windowf8', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf8.focus()">Fig. 8</A>).

<A NAME="cardio6"></A>
<P><H3><I>Medial Mineralization</I></H3>

<P>Mineralization of the media of vessels occurs infrequently in mice compared to rats. It may 
involve the elastic fibers in the muscle wall of vessels in a variety of organs and stains intensely 
basophilic with H & E stain. Small thalamic vessels are one of the most common sites of involvement 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Morgan1983">Morgan <I>et al.</I>, 1983</A>). These areas of mineralization exhibit faint or intense 
basophilia, with distinct concentric laminations 
(<a href="javascript:windowf9 = window.open('../figures/figure9.shtml', 'windowf9', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf9.focus()">Fig. 9</A>).

<A NAME="cardio7"></A>
<P><H3><I>Atherosclerosis</I></H3>

<P>Atherosclerosis is an extremely rare spontaneous lesion in mice. One author (CHF) has seen two 
cases. They occurred in the thoracic aorta and were characterized by a vacuolization within the 
thickened tunica intima (Figs. 
<a href="javascript:windowf10 = window.open('../figures/figure10.shtml', 'windowf10', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf10.focus()">10</A> and 
<a href="javascript:windowf11 = window.open('../figures/figure11.shtml', 'windowf11', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf11.focus()">11</A>). 
Subintimal plaques have been reported in some 
mouse strains 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Rehm1985b">Rehm <I>et al.</I>, 1985b</A>).

<A NAME="cardio8"></A>
<P><H3><I>Polyarteritis</I></H3>

<P>Polyarteritis in the mouse has been compared to periarteritis nodosa in man 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Kumar1979">Kumar, 1979</A>). The etiology of both is unknown, but an immune origin is suspected. 
It is sometimes seen in Murine Lupus 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Andrews1978">Andrews, 1978</A>) or may be associated with glomerulonephritis of unknown etiology 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Ward1986b">Ward <I>et al.</I>, 1986b</A>). In mice, the lesion involves small muscular arteries 
and is usually evident in multiple sites. Organs commonly involved include the heart, tongue, 
uterus, testes, kidney and urinary bladder. The media of the affected vessels is homogenous and 
intensely eosinophilic with H & E stain. Both fibrosis and an infiltration of mononuclear cells 
occur around the affected vessels 
(<a href="javascript:windowf12 = window.open('../figures/figure12.shtml', 'windowf12', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf12.focus()">Fig. 12</A>).

<A NAME="cardio9"></A>
<P><H3><I>Angiectasis</I></H3>

<P>Angiectasis refers to a dilatation of vascular channels and usually is associated with 
lymphatics, veins or sinusoids. The lesion can occur in any organ but most commonly involves the 
spleen, ovary, liver or lymph nodes. The etiology and pathogenesis of angiectasis are often obscure. 
Angiectasis of the ovaries is an age-related change and is commonly associated with ovarian atrophy. 
Usually little normal ovarian parenchyma is present, but markedly dilated vessels engorged with 
erythrocytes are evident 
(<a href="javascript:windowf13 = window.open('../figures/figure13.shtml', 'windowf13', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf13.focus()">Fig. 13</A>). 
Hepatic angiectasis involves dilatation of the vascular sinusoids and may 
be either focal or diffuse 
(<a href="javascript:windowf14 = window.open('../figures/figure14.shtml', 'windowf14', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf14.focus()">Fig. 14</A>). 
Angiectasis must be distinguished from hemangioma, sometimes with 
difficulty. Portions of hemangiomas may appear as angiectatic lesions in some sections of the tumor. 
In angiectasis, the existing vascular spaces are dilated and prominent and their lining endothelial 
cells are normal in appearance, number and size.

<A NAME="cardio10"></A>
<P><H3><I>Hemangioma and Hemangiosarcoma</I></H3>

<P>Hemangioma and hemangiosarcoma are relatively common spontaneous and induced vascular tumors in mice 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Frith1982">Frith and Wiley, 1982</A>). Hemangiomas are characterized by a focal nodular 
proliferation of normal appearing vessels. They are commonly found in the uterus 
(<a href="javascript:windowf15 = window.open('../figures/figure15.shtml', 'windowf15', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf15.focus()">Fig. 15</A>) 
and may be visible grossly as small red nodules in the parenchyma of 
organs. The vessels are dilated and are lined by normal appearing, flattened endothelial cells. 
Besides the uterus, hemangiomas have also been seen in ovary, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, 
subcutaneous tissue, preputial gland and the urinary bladder.

<P>The malignant counterpart of the hemangioma, the hemangiosarcoma, commonly involves a larger 
variety of organs. Hemangiosarcoma as primary neoplasms are seen in the subcutis, ovaries, mammary 
tissue, liver 
(<a href="javascript:windowf16 = window.open('../figures/figure16.shtml', 'windowf16', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf16.focus()">Fig. 16</A>), 
spleen, uterus and urinary bladder. The lesion may occur in multiple 
sites and it is sometime difficult to distinguish multicentric origin from secondary metastases 
(<a href="javascript:windowf17 = window.open('../figures/figure17.shtml', 'windowf17', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf17.focus()">Fig. 17</A>). 
The malignant endothelial cells are quite plump and form both solid 
sheets of anaplastic (undifferentiated cells) as well as vascular channels (capillary or cavernous) 
lined by better differentiated cells and filled with erythrocytes. Grossly, the neoplasm appears 
red because of the erythrocytes within the blood vascular channels.
