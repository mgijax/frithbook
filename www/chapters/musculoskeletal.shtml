<A NAME="musculo2"></A>
<P><H2>Bone</H2>

<A NAME="musculo3"></A>
<P><H3><I>Fibro-osseous Lesion</I></H3>

<P>Fibro-osseous lesions are observed in the sternebrae and other bones of a number of strains of 
mice as spontaneous and induced lesions, especially in females. The lesions occur earlier and 
are more severe in mice given estrogens 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Highman1981">Highman <I>et al.</I>, 1981</A>; 
<A HREF="references.shtml#Sass1980">Sass and Montali, 1980</A>). These lesions consist of partial or complete replacement of 
the marrow cavity with an eosinophilic matrix that contains spindle-shaped fibroblasts, osteoclasts 
and a few normal appearing cells (Figs. 
<a href="javascript:windowf320 = window.open('../figures/figure320.shtml', 'windowf320', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf320.focus()">320</A> 
and 
<a href="javascript:windowf321 = window.open('../figures/figure321.shtml', 'windowf321', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf321.focus()">321</A>). 
The matrix is rich in collagen and may contain a few spicules of partly 
mineralized osteoid and a few trabeculae of woven or lamellar bone. Some lesions are accompanied 
by a dense network of bony trabeculae, giving a sclerotic appearance to the affected sternebra. 
Similar changes have also been reported in long bones. These changes do have some morphologic 
resemblance to fibrous osteodystrophy. However, the kidneys and parathyroids in these mice 
are usually histologically normal.

<A NAME="musculo4"></A>
<P><H3><I>Osseous Metaplasia</I></H3>

<P>Osseous metaplasia is occasionally seen in areas of old injury. It has been found in the kidney 
(<a href="javascript:windowf322 = window.open('../figures/figure322.shtml', 'windowf322', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf322.focus()">Fig. 322</A>), 
urinary bladder and lung.

<A NAME="musculo5"></A>
<P><H3><I>Osteosarcoma</I></H3>

<P>Osteoma and osteosarcoma are rare in most strains of mice but have been seen in more than 
20% of OF-1 mice 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Wilson1985">Wilson <I>et al.</I>, 1985</A>), usually occur in aged animals and are more common 
in female than in male mice 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Frith1982x">Frith <I>et al.</I>, 1982</A>). The incidence can be increased with estrogens 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Highman1981">Highman <I>et al.</I>, 1981</A>). Three morphological types have been described. The 
osteoblastic type is characterized by the presence of prominent osteoid formation being produced 
by the neoplastic osteoblasts (Figs. 
<a href="javascript:windowf323 = window.open('../figures/figure323.shtml', 'windowf323', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf323.focus()">323</A> 
and 
<a href="javascript:windowf324 = window.open('../figures/figure324.shtml', 'windowf324', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf324.focus()">324</A>). 
The fibroblastic type contains primarily a fibrous stroma with minimal 
production of osteoid. The mixed type contains prominent areas of both of the preceding types.

<P>Osteosarcomas develop in the calvarium, the long bones of the limbs, the vertebrae and 
occasionally the pelvic bones. Osteosarcomas probably metastasize more frequently than any 
other malignant naturally occurring neoplasm in the mouse 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Frith1981c">Frith <I>et al.</I>, 1981b</A>). Pulmonary metastases are the most common, but occasional hepatic 
(<a href="javascript:windowf325 = window.open('../figures/figure325.shtml', 'windowf325', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf325.focus()">Fig. 325</A>) 
and renal metastases have been seen. FBJ virus includes periosteal osteosarcomas which do not metastasize in mice 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Ward1978">Ward <I>et al.</I>, 1978</A>).

<A NAME="musculo6"></A>
<P><H2>Cartilage</H2>

<A NAME="musculo7"></A>
<P><H3><I>Chondrosarcoma</I></H3>

<P>Chondrosarcomas are extremely rare in mice. 
<a href="javascript:windowf326 = window.open('../figures/figure326.shtml', 'windowf326', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf326.focus()">Fig. 326</A> 
shows a chondrosarcoma.

<A NAME="musculo8"></A>
<P><H2>Muscle</H2>

<A NAME="musculo9"></A>
<P><H3><I>Rhabdomyosarcoma</I></H3>

<P>This malignant mesenchymal neoplasm is derived from skeletal muscle. The neoplasm is composed of 
large prominent spindle-shaped cells with occasional giant cells 
(<a href="javascript:windowf327 = window.open('../figures/figure327.shtml', 'windowf327', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf327.focus()">Fig. 327</A>). 
Mitotic figures are usually prominent. Cross striation may be visible with the PTAH stain, but it 
may be necessary to positively confirm the presence of myocyte organelles with electron microscopy.
