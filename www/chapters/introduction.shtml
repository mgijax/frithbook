<P><H1>INTRODUCTION</H1>

<P>The National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) and the Carcinogenesis Testing Program 
of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) have performed numerous toxicity and carcinogenesis studies 
in mice. Over the last several years these studies have resulted in the development of a large data 
base of both spontaneous and induced neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions. Although papers have 
been published by the staffs of both research programs on the incidence of a variety of spontaneous 
and induced lesions, no single document describing the morphology of both common and rare 
spontaneous and induced lesions in mice has appeared in the literature. The purpose of this 
monograph is to present morphologic descriptions of both nonneoplastic and neoplastic spontaneous 
and selected induced lesions in mice to interested investigators. The lesions are predominantly 
from the BALB/c strain and B6C3F1 hybrid mice, but are typical of those seen in all mouse strains 
and stocks studied.

<P>The BALB/cStCrlfC3H/Nctr inbred mouse subtrain was developed at the National Center for 
Toxicological Research (NCTR), Jefferson, Arkansas. The strain was Caesarian-derived and foster 
nursed on gnotobiotic C3H/HeSchGN mothers. Most of the studies at NCTR using the BALB/c mouse have 
been conducted with specific pathogen free-defined flora (SPF-DF) animals in a barrier-type facility 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Littlefield1979">Littlefield <I>et al.</I>, 1979</A>). The current NCTR data base contains 
microscopic findings on a total of over 60,000 BALB/c mice of which 6,500 are controls. 
Various BALB/c substrains have been widely used in toxicology and carcinogenesis studies.

<P>The B6C3F1 (C57BL/6N x C3H/HeN)F1 mouse is the F1 hybrid of the C57BL/6N female and the C3H/HeN 
male. Because of its hardiness, this hybrid has been used for a number of years in bioassays for 
chemical carcinogens at both NCI and NCTR. The parent strains originated from the Veterinary 
Resources Branch of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. The hybrids were usually 
produced at the National Cancer Institute's Frederick Cancer Research Center or at the Charels 
River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, Massachusetts.

<P>Complete necropsies were performed on most mice, and blocks from approximately 40 organs and 
tissues were collected for study. All organs were placed directly in Bouin's solution (BALB/c) or 
10% neutral buffered foralin (B6C3F1). After18-48 hours in Bouin's solution, the tissues were 
removed from the fixative, trimmed, and specified groups of tissues were placed in plastic 
cassettes with perforated bottoms and stainless steel tops. The cassettes were prelabeled with the 
animal number. The cassettes, each containing multiple tissues from a given animal, were dehydrated 
in alcohol, cleared in xylene, and infiltrated with paraffin on automatic tissue processors. After 
processing, the tissues were embedded in paraffin utilizing an embedding center. Sections were 
routinely cut at 5 &mu;m on rotary microtomes, and sections from 2 paraffin blocks were placed on 
a single slide when possible. The slides were labeled with the same number as the blocks and 
routinely stained with hematoxylin and eosin.

<P>The types and incidence of spontaneous lesions in aging mice varies with mouse strain and sex. 
Several papers and books have documented the incidence of these lesions in aging mice 
(see 
<A HREF="generalreferences.shtml">General References on Mouse Pathology</A>). Tumor incidence depends, in part, 
on strain, sex, age 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Sheldon1979">Sheldon and Greenman, 1979</A>; 
<A HREF="references.shtml#Ward1979a">Ward <I>et al.</I>, 1979a</A>; 
<A HREF="references.shtml#Frith1983j">Frith <I>et al.</I>, 1983a</A>) and necropsy protocol 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Frith1976c">Frith <I>et al.</I>, 1976</A>). Knowledge of naturally occurring lesions provides 
background information necessary to evaluate the significance of pathologic findings in a rodent 
safety assessment assay. Since infectious diseases may also affect the background lesions seen in 
mice, specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice, now commercially available, provide the best choice for 
use in safety testing.

<P>Classification of nonneoplastic and neoplastic lesions of mice is dependent on available 
information on the specific lesions; this includes morphologic, histochemical, immunocytochemical, 
ultrastructural and biologic information. Classification may also vary with one's life experience 
and personal bias. In this monograph, we use classifications based on information currently 
available on the biology, morphology, and histochemistry of murine tumors. This atlas illustrates 
the application of avidin-biotin immunocytochemistry for diagnoses of lesions in mice.

<P>The majority of natural and experimentally induced neoplasms pass through a stage of focal or 
diffuse hyperplasia in a tissue 
(<a href="javascript:windowf1 = window.open('../figures/figure1.shtml', 'windowf1', 'width=820,height=900,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf1.focus()">Fig. 1</A>), 
especially for epithelial tissues. Murine neoplasms may arise within areas 
of hyperplasia or <I>in situ</I> from normal tissue. They often develop first as well 
differentiated neplasms appearing benign in morphology and behavior. As they grow in size, they 
often become nodular, well circumscribed or delineated, compress adjacent normal tissue and are 
thus diagnosed as adenomas. In some organs, such as the liver and lung, focal areas of the benign 
tumors may suddenly become cytologically malignant. These malignant areas may eventually overgrow 
the benign tumor. The malignant tumor, a carcinoma if developed from epithelial tissues or a 
sarcoma if derived from mesenchymal tissues, may invade adjacent tissues and metastasize to 
regional lymph nodes, lungs and elsewhere. Transplantation of tumors to syngeneic hosts may 
prove their neoplastic rather than malignant nature, since morphologically and biologically benign 
tumors can occasionally be transplanted. Many carcinogens induce specific morphologic types of tumors 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Ward1984a">Ward, 1984a</A>). The causes and pathogenesis of many spontaneous lesions in aging mice 
are unknown. Viruses are known to cause some sarcomas and leukemias. Genetics also play a role in 
susceptibility to some tumors. Nonneoplastic lesions often have no apparent cause, and some are 
related to aging changes in the endocrine system. Infectious diseases often have characteristic 
lesions which are diagnostic for the etiologic agent and are not seen in SPF mice.

<P>The severity of nonneoplastic age-realted degenerative lesions may be graded as minimal (1 +), 
mild (2 +), moderate (3 +)or severe or marked (4 +). Occassionally, exposure to the test chemical or 
agent may increase or decrease the severity of the aging lesions. In mice, age-related lesions are 
strain dependent. They may occur in any tissue but most commonly are seen in the brain, liver, 
gonads, reproductive tract and kidney.

<P>Toxic agents or infections may reduce the proportion of mice reaching the tumor age of various 
neoplasms, thereby reducing the overall incidence of tumors and necessitating comparing lesions in 
control and experimental animals by comparable age. Toxic agents may impair immunity and increase 
overall incidence of a lesion so there is no statistical difference in the overall incidence of the 
lesion between treated mice and controls; however, in treated mice, the lesion appears earlier and 
is more severe on the average, so that an analysis of the incidence of more severe forms of the 
lesion at a given age often proves to be significantly greater in treated mice than in controls.
